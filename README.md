## Dependencies

- Python 3
    - CCOBRA
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - seaborn

## Run analysis scripts

All analysis scripts can be run without any arguments. To run a specific script, use:

```
cd /path/to/repository/analysis
$> python [script].py
```

The plots are then saved in the same directory.

## Run model analyses

The aggregated analysis and the plotting of the results can be run like the analysis scripts.
For the CCOBRA evaluation, the benchmark file can be executed by the following commands:

```
cd /path/to/repository/model_eval/individual
$> ccobra multi_jaccard.json
```

A HTML file containing the results will be placed in the same directory. The results can be saved as a CSV file from there (resembling the file stored in the results subfolder).
